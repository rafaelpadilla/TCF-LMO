Here you can find videos and frames of the testing set output by our network.

## Videos

Videos were created with the outputs produced by each module of our network. They can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fT47n0jqyovuahhQRhFF6KNFJL-Pp-g0?usp=sharing).

As the videos are short (201 frames only), their frame rate was reduced for a better visualization.

## Frames

Every frame of the testing set output by every module of our network can be accessed [here](

These frames can be used as benchmarking with other approaches.
